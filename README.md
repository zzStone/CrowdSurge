I focus on the 3rd puzzle: sorting algorithm.  The input file is under home directory and is generated by calling "gensort".  It is a binary file of 60000 records(6MB).

Under ./java_heapsort directory, there are two files: HeapSort.java and java_output(binary file).  Within HeapSort.java, there is main method call heapSort() method and write the output as java_output.

Under ./sort directory, there are two .go files: heapSort.go and insertion.go.  There 2 files contain two algorithms method as their names.

Under home directory, there is main.go file consuming input file and call 2 algorithms.  Thus, it generates 2 output binary files with sorted records:  heapsort_output and insertionsort_output.

Test: All 3 output files are tested by "valsort", and the records are sorted correctly.

Analysis:  The memory usage of the 2 algorithms are both O(n), because the algorithms do in-place sorting, hence there is no extra usage of space except [m][100]byte array, where m is the count of records.  The time complexity of heapSort is O(mlogm) and the complexity of insertionSort is O(m^2).
